Description: Simulation, inference and clustering of multilevel networks using a
    Stochastic Block Model framework as described in Chabert-Liddell, Barbillon,
    Donnet and Lazega (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2021.107179>. 
    A multilevel network is defined as the junction of two interaction networks, 
    the upper level or inter-organizational level and the lower level or 
    inter-individual level. The inter-level represents an affiliation 
    relationship.
