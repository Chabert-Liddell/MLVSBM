Description: Simulation, inference and clustering of multilevel networks using a
    Stochastic Block Model framework as described in Chabert-Liddell et al. 
    (2020) <arXiv:1910.10512>. A multilevel network is defined as the 
    junction of two interaction networks, the upper level or 
    inter-organizational level and the lower level or inter-individual level. 
    The inter-level represents an affiliation relationship.
