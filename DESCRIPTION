Description: Simulation, inference and clustering of multilevel network using a
    Stochastic Block Model framework as described in the following paper: 
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10512. A multilevel network is defined as the 
    junction of two interaction networks, the upper level or inter-organizational  
    level and the lower level or inter-individual level. 
    The inter-level represents an affiliation relationship.
